# AI Code Reviewer

A powerful VS Code extension that provides intelligent code review capabilities with both AI-powered analysis and offline rule-based validation. Get comprehensive code feedback that combines the depth of AI reasoning with the reliability of predefined best practices.

## 🚀 Features

### AI-Powered Code Review
- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverage GPT models for deep code analysis and suggestions
- **Intelligent Insights**: Get context-aware recommendations for code quality, architecture, and best practices
- **Configurable Models**: Support for various OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, etc.)

### Offline Fallback System
- **Rule-Based Analysis**: Comprehensive offline code review using predefined rules
- **No Internet Required**: Works completely offline when AI services are unavailable
- **Instant Feedback**: Fast analysis without API calls or waiting times

### Multi-Language Support
- **Frontend**: React, Flutter, Next.js, Angular
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, NestJS, Spring Boot, Go, Java, C++
- **Full Stack**: REST API, GraphQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

### Comprehensive Analysis Areas
- **Code Quality**: Clean code principles, readability, maintainability
- **Architecture**: Separation of concerns, design patterns, scalability
- **Security**: Data validation, vulnerability prevention
- **Performance**: Optimization opportunities, resource usage
- **Best Practices**: Framework-specific guidelines and conventions

## 📦 Installation

1. Download the `.vsix` file from the releases
2. Open VS Code
3. Go to Extensions → Install from VSIX
4. Select the downloaded file

## ⚙️ Configuration

### OpenAI Setup (Optional)
Configure your OpenAI API key for AI-powered reviews:

```json
{
  "aiCodeReviewer.openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key-here",
  "aiCodeReviewer.openaiModel": "gpt-4o-mini"
}
```

### Settings
- **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key (machine-scoped for security)
- **Model**: Choose your preferred OpenAI model (default: gpt-4o-mini)

## 🛠️ Usage

### Review Current File
1. Open any code file in VS Code
2. Use Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+P`)
3. Run: `AI: Review Current File`
4. Select your code scope (frontend/backend/both)
5. Choose your tech stack
6. Get instant code review results

### How It Works

The extension uses a smart two-tier approach prioritizing reliability:

1. **Primary**: Always performs fast, reliable offline rule-based analysis
2. **Enhancement**: Optionally enhances results with AI-powered insights when available
3. **Hybrid**: Guaranteed offline results with optional AI enhancement

## 🤝 Contributing

### Adding New Rules
1. Create rule files in appropriate language/framework directories
2. Follow the `ReviewRule` interface structure
3. Add tests for rule validation
4. Update the rules index

### Rule Structure
```typescript
{
  id: "UNIQUE-RULE-ID",
  area: "Component Design",
  principle: "SRP",
  severity: "BLOCKER",
  appliesTo: { framework: ["react"], scope: ["frontend"] },
  check: (code) => boolean, // Validation logic
  message: "Clear error message",
  rationale: "Why this rule matters"
}
```
